        description: "The Monstera, also known as a Swiss Cheese plant, originates from the forests of central and south America. In its tropical home, the ornamental leaf plant winds liana-like around tree trunks up to the crowns of the forest giants. The Monstera deliciosa is one of the most widely spread varieties. It has once again become fashionable as a houseplant for the past few years. Monstera prints decorate furnishings and posters. It has once again become fashionable and individual Monstera leaves stylishly decorate vases. The large-leaved plants with their conspicuous, slit leaves, draw everyone’s attention. Their easy-care has also contributed extensively to their popularity\n\n"
        + "There are between 20 and 50 species of the genus Monstera, which vary in leaf-shape and growth. While some have deep, pinnatifid leaves, others are less extensively holey and form no or only a few aerial roots. Unlike most other Swiss Cheese species, the margins of the ‘Monkey Leaf’ Monstera remain closed, so they retain their holey appearance."

        description: "This is a living dwarf tree. The word bonsai can also refer to the art of training and growing these dwarf plants in containers. \n\n Bonsai specimens are ordinary trees and shrubs, not hereditary dwarfs; they are dwarfed by a system of pruning roots and branches and training branches by tying them with wire. The art originated in China, but has been pursued and developed primarily by the Japanese. The inspiration for bonsai is found in nature, in trees that grow in harsh, rocky places, and are dwarfed and gnarled throughout their existence. Bonsai may live for a century or more and can be handed down from one generation to another. Bonsai pots, usually earthenware and of variable shape, are carefully chosen to harmonize in color and proportion with the tree. \n\n A sizable bonsai industry exists as part of the nursery industry in Japan. California is home to a small-scale bonsai industry."

        description: "Ficus, (genus Ficus), genus of about 900 species of trees, shrubs, and vines in the family Moraceae, many of which are commonly known as figs. Native primarily to tropical areas of East Asia, they are distributed throughout the world’s tropics. Many are tall forest trees that are buttressed by great spreading roots; others are planted as ornamentals.\n\n"
        + "Most Ficus species are evergreen; there are a few deciduous members in nontropical areas. The leaves are usually simple and waxy, and most exude white or yellow latex when broken. Many species have aerial roots, and a number are epiphytic. The unusual fruit structure, known as a syconium, is hollow, enclosing an inflorescence with tiny male and female flowers lining the inside.\n\n"
        + "Members of the genus are characterized by a unique pollination syndrome. Each species is pollinated by and houses the young of a species-specific wasp (see fig wasp). This remarkable pollination system has a fundamental impact on tropical forest ecology. When the pollen-bearing wasp leaves a Ficus plant, the fruit crop ripens quickly, providing a rich feast that attracts a host of mammals and birds.\n\n Moreover, as a consequence of the wasp’s short adult lifetime (as little as two days), there are some trees both receiving and releasing fig wasps throughout the year. This pattern results in a steady supply of fruit, making Ficus fruits a critical resource for many animals during times of food shortage. If the plants were to be cut out of a forest or the fig wasps were to somehow be removed, there would almost certainly be a dramatic reduction in animal life, as is suggested by the lower population densities of fruit-eating mammals on small islands that lack Ficus species."
